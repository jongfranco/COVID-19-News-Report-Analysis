# COVID-19-News-Report-Analysis
In this project, we collected news from CNN and research papers from Google Scholar related to COVID-19 to analyze text content.
We collected news reporting about China/EU countries and generated customized word cloud, which user could choose image from internet
to generated whatever shape wordcloud. 
Moreover, we collected research papers to see what experts think at this stage.
Finally, we implemented information retrieval task, where our code will print out top 10 news relevant to query text.
Hopefully, we can gain more insight through this project.
